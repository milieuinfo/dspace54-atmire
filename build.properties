# DSpace build.properties
# This file should be customised to suit your build environment.
# Note that not all configuration is handled here, only the most common
# properties that tend to differ between build environments.
# For adjusting global settings or more complex settings, edit the relevant config file.
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not remove or comment out settings in build.properties
# When you edit the "build.properties" file (or a custom *.properties file),
# take care not to remove or comment out any settings. Doing so, may cause
# your final "dspace.cfg" file to be misconfigured with regards to that
# particular setting.  Instead, if you wish to remove/disable a particular
# setting, just clear out its value.  For example, if you don't want to be
# notified of new user registrations, ensure the "mail.registration.notify"
# setting has no value, e.g. "mail.registration.notify="

# HANDLE CONFIGURATION #
########################

# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# By default, DSpace is configured to use http://hdl.handle.net/
# as the canonical URL prefix when generating dc.identifier.uri
# during submission, and in the 'identifier' displayed in JSPUI
# item record pages.
#
# If you do not subscribe to CNRI's handle service, you can change this
# to match the persistent URL service you use, or you can force DSpace
# to use your site's URL, eg.
#handle.canonical.prefix = ${dspace.url}/handle/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifer.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions), but it will alter the URL
# in JSPUI's 'identifier' message on item record pages for existing items.
#
# If omitted, the canonical URL prefix will be http://hdl.handle.net/
